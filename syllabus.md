A. DESCRIPTION
This course involves a careful examination of drafting as a tool of technical communication and for solving graphical problems.  Emphases are on development of basic drafting skills, visualization, and solution of spatial problems.  It is an exploratory, first course in drafting designed primarily for students planning to enroll in the regular-program Drafting Technology courses upon completion of this course.  However, it also meets the needs of many students with other interests, as a refresher course in drafting, a course for upgrading drafting skills, a course for IED students training to be public school industrial arts teachers, or a course that provides students with a general "feel" for the subject of drafting.

B. ORGANIZATION

This is a lecture-lab course in which topics are presented by the instructor, practice drawings are explained, and assigned drawings are completed by students both during lab periods and outside of class.  Objective and drawing-type quizzes are given daily, and there is a comprehensive final exam.  The course is a prerequisite for the beginning regular-program drafting courses.  DRAFT 19 students generally have had neither high school or other drafting training, nor experience in drafting employment.  So when students in this course proceed to the regular-program drafting courses, if they do, they will be at approximately the same level of expertise as those who have had previous training or experience and who are permitted to waive DRAFT 19.  This basic drafting course therefore assumes no previous drafting experience or training, so the initial emphases are on the use of equipment and basic procedures.

C. COURSE OBJECTIVES

To introduce students to the use of mechanical drafting tools, to drafting procedures, and to acceptable standards of work in the industry.
	To introduce students to various forms of graphical representation and to selection of representations appropriate to specific needs.
		To introduce students to time and quality drafting production requirements.To orient students to the range of drafting methods, topics, and occupations that characterize the field.
			To provide students with opportunities to develop basic drafting skills in respect to sheet composition, working neatly and accurately, lettering, and line drawing.

D. COURSE TOPICS

The course will cover the following topics:
Equipment and Basic Drafting Procedures
Lettering; Symbols
Drafting Geometry and Single-View Drawing
Orthographic Projection
Dimensions
Auxiliary Views
Sectional Views
Pictorial Drawing (isometric and perspective drawing)
Threads
Weldments
Developments
Introduction to Descriptive Geometry
Introduction to Computer Drafting
Architectural Working Drawings (plans, sections, and elevations)

E. TEXT AND REQUIRED SUPPLIES

Required text: Basic Technical Drawing, by Spencer & Dygdon
Supplies:  see separate list with pictures.

F. GRADING PLAN

Coursework will be weighted as follows:

1. Drawings		45%
2. Quizzes				25%
3. Final exam			20%
4. Attendance					10% 
				---		---		---
				45%  +  45%  +  10%  =  100%
DRAWINGS:
A drawing will be assigned almost every class period.  Each drawing will be graded unless there are major errors or omissions and it is returned for correction or completion.  Drawings with minor detail or other non-conceptual errors will be graded as submitted, and letter grades will be given.  Drawing due dates will be given to you for each assignment.  Drawings will usually be due at the beginning of class periods on the due dates (unless specifically stated otherwise).  Unless you are absent on the day an assignment is due, it will not be accepted later than at the beginning of the class period when it is due.  If you are absent from class when a drawing is due, it will be accepted late -- but only if submitted immediately upon your return and only if an acceptable, written "excuse," is presented.  If you cannot attend class when a drawing is due and cannot provide an acceptable written excuse, you should send your drawing to class with a friend, family member, or other person.  An "acceptable" excuse for an absence is only one which is judged so by the instructor.  Due dates will not be changed because of earlier absences.

QUIZZES:
There will be many drawing-type and other quizzes (probably one almost every class period).  Quizzes will relate to current and previous topics.  A quiz may be given at any time during any class period -- immediately after a lecture, at the beginning or end of a class, etc.  There will be no make-up quizzes -- none even later during the same class period.  Quizzes will be given only to those students who are present when the quizzes are passed out.

FINAL EXAM:
The final exam will be comprehensive and entirely drawing-type.  It will be given at the time shown at the end of the schedule that follows.

ATTENDANCE:
Attendance will be graded as follows:No absencesA+One absenceATwo absencesBThree absencesCFour or more absencesF

Absences for which a medical or court excuse is provided (professional letterhead required) will be recorded but not figured in the attendance grade.  Likewise, one absence for which advance notice is given by phone or in person will not be figured in the attendance grade.  Any significant tardy or early departure from class will be figured as a half absence.
Also, anyone who has more than four class-long, unexcused absences will receive an "F" grade for the COURSE.  Keep in mind that this is an occupational course, and attendance is important here just as it will be in the employment for which this course is in part designed to prepare you.

GENERAL:
Your recorded grades will be available for your review at any convenient time.  Do remember to keep all drawings and quizzes returned to you so that any discrepancies can be easily and fairly straightened out.  Except in cases of actual error, final grades are permanent.  The last day to withdraw from the course is Friday, October 16.
Final "I" grades will not be permitted except in cases of prolonged, continuous, and excused absences in the latter half of the course.  Under no circumstances will an "I" grade be given when more than half of the coursework has not been completed.
Final "N" grades will be given only in very rare and exceptional cases.  An "N" will never be given simply to replace a grade that you would prefer not to receive.
You will be required to meet privately with the instructor in his office at least one time outside of class time early in the course and to complete at least two evaluation-type exercises during the course.

G. CLASSROOM RULES OF CONDUCT
Radios may be listened to at a reasonable volume from 9 to 11.
No drawing is permitted during lecture periods.
Food and beverages are not permitted in the classroom. This includes plate lunches, drinks, candy, etc. whether opened or not.
Class lab time is expected to be spent in lab work.  Lab time is not free time.  Attendance and concerted work on assignments are required.  Work at home will be required in addition to work during lab times (work at home should not substitute for work during lab periods).

H. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES

Evacuation procedures -- see instructions posted in the classroom.
First aid kit -- located in Room 612.  All instructors have a key to the room.
Emergency ambulance -- from any instructor's office, phone "9" to get an outside line, then "911."  There are also phones on other floors and at the bookstore and nurse's office on the ground floor.
Campus security -- phone "142" Mon, Tues, or Fri 7:00 am - 4:30 pm, Wed or Thrs 7:00am - 6:30pm; phone "245" Mon through Wed 5:00 pm - 10:00 pm, Thrs 5:00 pm - 8:00 pm.  

I. YOUR IDEAS, EVALUATIONS, ETC.

In general, your ideas, comments, suggestions, questions, grade challenges, etc. are welcome.  Your discretion in these matters is expected, however.  No part of your grade will be based on anything other than your coursework and attendance.
You are encouraged to take advantage of instructor office hours for help with coursework or anything else connected with the course and your progress.

J. SUGGESTIONS FOR SUCCESS

For most students this will not be a "difficult" course. However, there will probably be some students who did well in academic courses where information was most important and who will be surprised at the relative difficulty of this course where manual skills and visualization are most important.  So do not think that if you are a "B" student you will probably get a "B" in this course.  You might get an "A" with relative ease . . . or a "C" with difficulty, and still be (and correctly so) a "B student" in your information-heavy, mainly lecture-type courses.  The courses that follow this will be significantly different.

TENTATIVE SCHEDULE
A daily or weekly schedule is not a required part of or required addendum to a syllabus. It does, however, help keep the course on track throughout a semester, help the instructor from "running out of time" at the end of a course, enable students to always see what is coming up or what they will miss if absent, and evidences good planning and organization. It also saves the instructor significant planning time during the course.
