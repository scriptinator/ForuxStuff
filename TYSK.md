## Things You Should Know 
1. Armor is weighted, diamond armor is heavier then iron armor, and thus will make you slower.
2. There are custom enchantments, you can get them randomly with a level 30 enchant.
3. Ender Chests are banned you can not craft nor use them
4. If you suspect someone is using killaura, do /auracheck. This command has cooldown of 10 minutes. If the result is more than 1 then report them using /helpop
